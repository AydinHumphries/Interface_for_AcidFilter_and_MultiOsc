# Interface_for_AcidFilter_and_MultiOsc

This is the interface for the acid filter and multi-osc I built using ReallyUsefulPlugins' youtube tutorials and creating my own pattern generator (rhythmic/melodic). "interface.pd" is the one you want to open - the others are just abstractions that need to be in the same folder.
